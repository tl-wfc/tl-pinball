when running on warrens Laptop
mpf -x (no hardware mode)

installing MPF monitor
from the environment

Power Shell Commands

mpf
What it does
Connects to FAST hardware
Enables coils, switches, lights
Starts attract mode
Runs game logic
Opens BCP connection (Godot can connect)

Use for:
• playing the machine
• final testing
• cabinet use



mpf -x
Hardware mode without media controller
Meaning:
“Run the pinball machine but no display computer.”

FAST hardware active
coils fire
switches work
Godot not required

Use for:
• diagnosing FAST connection issues
• coil problems
• power board problems
• serial connection every-second-boot issue


mpf -b
Display / logic development mode (NO hardware)

What it disables
FAST boards
coils
switches

What it keeps
scoring
modes
player variables
events
BCP (Godot communication)

mpf -t
Virtual platform (keyboard switches)

Adds:
keyboard simulated switches
fake ball devices
Use for:
• testing gameplay without a machine


mpf -xt
slide-development mode (GMC)

Meaning:
no FAST hardware
virtual switches
perfect for Godot
This is the intended MPF + GMC workflow.







Live event & switch viewer (extremely important)

mpf monitor

Shows:
every switch hit
every event
mode changes
ball controller
scoring




Device test shell
mpf test
Interactive testing:
fire coils manually
read switches
inspect devices



mpf diagnosis
Machine diagnostic report

Prints:
config validation
devices detected
platform info
Good for “MPF refuses to start” situations.





Verbose log
mpf -v


Very verbose log
mpf -V


--no-load-cache
Forces MPF to reload YAML configs
mpf --no-load-cache




-l <file>
Write a log file
mpf -l mpf.log
Very useful when diagnosing crashes.


-c <configfile>
Use a specific config
mpf -c config.yaml



Combined examples (real workflows)
Working on Godot slides
mpf -xt -v --no-load-cache

Playing the real machine
mpf -v

Debugging FAST hardware
mpf -x -v

Watching switch inputs
mpf monitor

Deep debugging
mpf -V --no-load-cache
